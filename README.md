## What is this

TagQt is a desktop music metadata editor for Windows and Linux. It reads and writes tags for MP3, FLAC, OGG, M4A, and WAV files. You can edit files one at a time or select multiple files and apply changes in bulk.

The interface uses the Catppuccin color theme with four flavors: Latte, Frappé, Macchiato, and Mocha. There is a command palette (`Ctrl+K`) for quick access to every action.

## Features

TagQt can auto-tag files from MusicBrainz, filling in artist, album, year, track number, and genre. It fetches lyrics from multiple providers including Musixmatch (word-synced and line-synced) and LRCLIB. Provider order and selection are configurable. It can search and download album artwork with configurable cover resolution.

A built-in music player lets you play through your tracks in display order. When a track has LRC timestamps in its lyrics, the lyrics box highlights the current line in sync with playback.

Files can be batch renamed using tag patterns like `%artist% - %title%`. FLAC files can be re-encoded to 24 bit 48kHz using ffmpeg. Korean and CJK text in lyrics and tags can be romanized automatically. Metadata can be imported and exported as CSV, and filename or tag case can be converted between title case, upper, and lower.

You can drag and drop files or folders directly onto the window to load them.
